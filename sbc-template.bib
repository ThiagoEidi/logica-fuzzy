abstract = {When hearing the term fuzzy logic, the first thing that the mind immediately goes to is the field of non-deterministic arguments, and if we want to use a term close to it to make its meaning a little clearer, we can say that fuzzy logic is the same as Armagon's logic. It is an approximation that, ironically, the literal meaning of the word "argument" also refers to the clarification of something by the same thing (function input or armagon). Now the basic question is that while the educated mind of man has considered logic as equivalent to the mechanism of definite perceptions and accurate results for more than a thousand years, how can we talk about the invention of a logical method that is based on uncertainty? This question is doubly important from the aspect that our approximate arguments in the context of our lived life are more than our exact, definite and unambiguous arguments, that is, the same arguments that classical logic, whether in its old or new language, He leaves it aside and does not pay attention to them, and of course he is forced to do this because he does not have the tools to analyze these arguments. This is where we unknowingly remind ourselves of Bacon's angry regret, who considers Aristotelian logic to be a fantasy that causes waste and diversion of great talents over many centuries, a continuous and constant effort without helping a person to improve the quality of his life; A bunch of delusional nonsense, the result of which, perhaps in the most optimistic state, is Scott's adversary and the victory of futility in verbal disputes, of course, if we do not say only pointless boasting and scrutiny based on rhetoric, the fruit of which is the explanation of rational axioms. If Mr. Bacon knew about fuzzy logic, he would have corrected his view of logic, and to be more precise, he would have separated Aristotle from logic, not logic from science. One of the most important advantages of fuzzy logic is that it can introduce a way to enter the knowledge and experiences of experts into intelligent systems that are based on sensitive and practical decisions and choices and develop the previous absolute correct and incorrect logic. The basis of the analysis in the present research is to examine the components of two types of logic, i.e. classical logic and fuzzy logic, and clarify the understanding of the logical concepts and philosophical foundations of classical logic, as well as comparing it with the concepts of fuzzy logic. The research results indicate: these two types of logic have fundamental differences from an epistemological point of view; Aristotle's epistemological foundation is based on the certainty-oriented duality of "either this/or that", while the fuzzy epistemological foundation is based on a multi-valued system and that both logics are a contradictory understanding of what the mind and the external world are and the connection between They both give hands.},

abstract = {A fuzzy set is a class of objects with a continuum of grades of membership. Such a set is characterized by a membership (characteristic) function which assigns to each object a grade of membership ranging between zero and one. The notions of inclusion, union, intersection, complement, relation, convexity, etc., are extended to such sets, and various properties of these notions in the context of fuzzy sets are established. In particular, a separation theorem for convex fuzzy sets is proved without requiring that the fuzzy sets be disjoint.}
